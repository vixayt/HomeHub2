This web app allows users to see their weather forecast and see when MAX transit times will arrive.

## How To run the is app

First requirement is ensuring you have an API key from:

- Open Weather Map
- Dark Sky Weather, and
- Trimet

  Ensure you have got a Node version (`node -v`) greater than v10.9.  
  Go into the `server` directory. If you run the command `npm run test-build`, this should install the packages and run both the frontend and the backend.
  After running this command, the web app should be running on localhost:4200/

## Todo

- Sign in
- Input zip code for weather
- Input max lines for trimet
